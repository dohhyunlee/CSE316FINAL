## Follow Instructions

move to server dir
### `npm install`
### `node server.js`
move to client dir
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This example was from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose 

Read the article series further to learn more about using MongoDB and Mongoose.

To populate the database

    node populatedb <your mongodb url>

For example, to use the URL listed in the project

    node populatedb mongodb://localhost:27017/LibraryExample

To run the backend server, type:

    node app.js

Try going to:

    http://localhost:3000/api/authors

    http://localhost:3000/api/authors/6056bb8551936fb5c67c6c93

    http://localhost:3000/api/books

    http://localhost:3000/api/bookinstances

You can also test posting to the api/authors route. Make a post request and set the Body to be Raw + JSON and copy the below text in:
   
    {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "family_name": "Kim",
        "date_of_birth": "1988-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
